        <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>My main hobby when I have free time is playing video game. I have been playing video games as early as 4 years old.<br>
            Video games for me was a way to connect with friends regardless of the distance. <br>
            I have become better friends with people I have never met in person, than most of my classmates from school. <br>
            Over the years I have played over 1,000 games across multiple platforms, my largest Library of games being on Steam with 654 games as of writing.</p>
            <img class="pic3" src="Images/Game count.png" alt="Steam game count">
            <p>My favorite genera of video game are strategy games especially the RTS aka Real Time Strategy categories. <br>
            My Favorite RTS is <a class="inlinelink" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386070/Planetary_Annihilation_TITANS/">Planetary Annihilation titans</a> and <a class="inlinelink" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420/Supreme_Commander_Forged_Alliance/"> commander: Forged Alliance</a> <br>
            Both games have you drop into a map, where you use your commander to build up a base, expand and create an army to destroy the enemy players commander.</p>
