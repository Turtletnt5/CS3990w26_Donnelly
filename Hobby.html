        <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>My main hobby when I have free time is playing video game. I have been playing video games as early as 4 years old.<br>
            Video games for me was a way to connect with friends regardless of the distance. <br>
            I have become better friends with people I have never met in person, than most of my classmates from school. <br>
            Over the years I have played over 1,000 games across multiple platforms, my largest Library of games being on Steam with 654 games as of writing.</p>
